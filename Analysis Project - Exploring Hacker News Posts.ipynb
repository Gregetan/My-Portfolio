where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit.\n","\n","Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n","\n","There are various types of posts submitted to the Hacker News platform but for this project we are specifically interested in posts with titles that contains either ask HN or Show HN, where Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, and submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t5VlpaIgRsuj"},"source":["# Objectives and Methodologies\n","\n","Our goal for this project is to compare the Ask HN, Show HN, and other types of posts to determine the following:\n","\n","- Which of Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments on average?\n","- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n","\n","We will use Python programming language to explore and analyze the data, and Jupyter Notebook to present our code and findings."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hCd1Bh9kRsuk"},"source":["# Database Description\n","\n","The dataset used for this analysis is the hacker_news.csv, where it contains a total of
